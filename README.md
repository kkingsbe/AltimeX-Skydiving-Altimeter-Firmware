# AltimeX Firmware
This repo contains the firmware for an open-source skydiving altimeter that I created, which can be made for about $30. Sadly, the programmer cable costs anywhere from $60-$120, however if you need yours programmed you can reach out to me and we can work something out (I have one).

A LiPo with a capacity of at least 250mAh should be fine since the current draw of the board is minimal. A flowchart for how the code works can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/4zBiOo2lBxXKH4AfCIveim/OSCA-Flowchart?type=whiteboard&node-id=0-1&t=LwiWm71Q5GXqkpOq-0), and the CAD files for an enclosure that can fit in the audible pocket on helmets will be up soon once tested
